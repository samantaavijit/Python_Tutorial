LawToolBox Key Differentiators  |  Comparison Chart (“check all” that apply to your current system).

LawToolBox is a cloud-based centralized deadline management system for attorneys and paralegals that (i) calculates 
court rule-based deadlines, (ii) emails weekly deadline reports by paralegal, attorney, client, department or firm 
and (iii) sends email reminders for each deadline (for Macs and PCs).  When rules change law firms don’t need to wait 
for a software update, or delete and re-import deadlines; instead LawToolBox deadlines are automatically updated 
real-time, online and to their calendars. You can also overlay our rule-based deadlines with your own rule-based 
deadlines for your firm, practice or clients (for example, add deadlines for a favorite judges’ scheduling order, 
insurance adjuster or deadlines for specific practices like construction defect, medical malpractice, 
personal injury, etc.). Further, you can automatically omit deadlines that don’t apply. The  “history of changes” 
feature allows you to see who made what changes, and when, to your case deadlines!
